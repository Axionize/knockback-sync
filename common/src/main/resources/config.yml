# Grabs the ping of combat-tagged players every x ticks
# Disabling this may lead to inaccuracies in calculations
runnable:
  enabled: true       # Runnable enabled state
  interval: 20         # The interval in ticks between sending out pings to players
  combat_timer: 30    # The timer in ticks before being considered out of combat

# The minimum change in ping required for it to be considered a lag spike.
# If the difference between the latest and previous ping is greater than or equal to
# the threshold, the previous ping value is used to avoid calculation inaccuracies.
spike_threshold: 20

# OPTIONS: KEEPALIVE, PING, TRANSACTION - PING and TRANSACTION are aliases for each other and are effectively the same
# The packet type used to measure ping by the runnable.
# KEEPALIVE is the most accurate however sending too many of them too often (such as using a runnable with a low interval)
# - May disconnect players, especially laggy ones if sent too often
# - The default interval of 20 ticks or 1 second
#    means it is in theory possible for a player to have a ping spike in-between two sword attacks
#    and have it immediately spike back down, slightly throwing off knockback synchronization
#    in practice this is very rare and the extra ping accuracy and precision is more valued
# PING/TRANSACTION can be sent more often (and therefore better detect ping spikes) but are less precise
# ping measured in ms with PING/TRANSACTION is typically within Â± 5ms of actual but can be up to 50ms off
ping_strategy: "KEEPALIVE"

# This setting has yet to be implemented. Enable if you want it to be enabled as soon as the next update add support
